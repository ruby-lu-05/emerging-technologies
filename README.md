# Emerging Technologies Website

This project was created with HTML/CSS for ICS3UE (Grade 11 Computer Science).

It is a static website containing some simple information about the following "emerging technology" fields:
* Artificial Intelligence
* Self-Driving Cars
* 3D Printing
* Virtual Reality

There is also a reference page that contains links to my sources and the images used on the website.
