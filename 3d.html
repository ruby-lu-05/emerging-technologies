			<!-- SECTION 1: WHAT IS 3D PRINTING -->
			<h3>What is 3D Printing?</h3>
			<p>3D printing is a method of manufacturing that involves using computer-aided design (CAD) to produce <strong>3D objects</strong> with a variety of materials like molten plastic or powders. 3D printers use a <strong>layering method</strong> to create objects. In other words, they work from the ground up and add layers after layers until the object looks like the design.</p><br>

			<h3>How do 3D Printers Work?</h3>
			<h4>1) 3D Modelling</h4>
			<!-- heading for each step -->
			<hr class="light-line">
			<!-- description for each step -->
			<p>The first step of the 3D printing process is always <strong>3D modelling</strong>. Objects need to be designed in a 3D modelling software in order to maximize precision and let the 3D printer know what needs to be done.</p><br>
			<h4>2) Slicing</h4>
			<hr class="light-line">
			<p>In order for the printer to produce the object, the design needs to be <strong>“sliced” into layers</strong>. Slicing software can scan each layer of the model and tell the printer how to recreate that layer.</p><br>
			<h4>3) Printing Process</h4>
			<hr class="light-line">
			<p>3D printers have a nozzle that moves back and forth to <strong>dispense a wax or plastic-like polymer layer by layer</strong>. To create a 3D object, the printer essentially needs to add hundreds or thousands of 2D prints on top of each other.</p><br><br>

			<!-- SECTION 3: BENEFITS & PRICE OF 3D PRINTING -->
			<h3>Benefits of 3D Printing:</h3>
			<img src="dentistry.jpg" class="dentistry-img" alt="3D Printing Used in Dentistry">
			<ul style="width:45%;">
				<!-- unordered list of 3d printing benefits -->
				<li>3D printing can be extremely <strong>precise</strong>, since 3D modelling allows products to be customized down to the smallest details. For example, in dentistry, 3D software can be used to design custom teeth alignment tools that precisely fit the individual.<br><br></li>
				<li>3D printing can be used for <strong>rapid prototyping</strong>. Many companies can now use 3D printers to create prototypes in a matter of hours. It is estimated that 3D printers can make the prototyping process 10 times faster and 5 times cheaper.<br><br></li>
				<li>There is more that can go wrong with traditional manufacturing because of <strong>human error and potential problems with machinery</strong>.<br><br></li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Price of 3D Printing:</h3>
			<!-- price of 3d printing -->
			<p>The cost of 3D printers can vastly differ based on the size, specialty, or use. 3D printers can be as <strong>cheap as $200</strong>, but large industrial 3D printers can cost <strong>as much as $100,000</strong>. An average consumer would pay <strong>roughly $650</strong> for a 3D printer. In the future, prices are expected to significantly decrease as a result of 3D printing technology becoming more widely-adopted and widespread.</p><br id="applications">
